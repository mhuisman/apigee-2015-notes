### Launching a Platform and Igniting a Developer Community

- Adam FitzGerald, Head of Worldwide Developer Marketing at AWS
    - worked dev relations/marketing at BEA, springsource/vmware/pivotal, aws
- myth: marketing to developers is tough
    - but it is easy.. devs are a connoisseur of tech
    - have a refined taste of tech; compared to other groups
        - been repeatedly told how productions will solve problems; silver bullets
        - high bullshit meter
- how do devs choose a technology to use?
    - (source: Evans Resource Group and RedMonk)
    - primary criteria: does product X solve my problem?
        - example: patent for trumpet that shoots flames out.. patented in 1981
            - this solves a problem that doesn't exist
            - APIs need to be able to solve a problem.
    - second criteria: are other people using X?
        - 95%+ devs care about what others are using
        - when multiple tech solutions solve the same problem, the one with the best community wins
        - community matters: 
            - validates your choice
            - more people -> more likely to evolve
- Developer Marketing Basics (6 steps)
    - Step 1. Do Documentation Right
        - just writing swagger on endpoint is not enough
        - the developers should be writing the docs (not tech writers, evangelists)
        - the long-tail of web traffic
            - e.g., 75% of web traffic to spring webstie was to the docs section
                - thus, incredibly important to be accurate, correct
            - SEO optimize it 
        - see github blob post: [How GitHub uses GitHub to document GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1939-how-github-uses-github-to-document-github)
        - write your docs in markdown in github
            - use github pages (jekyll)
            - allows people to correct it/update/adapt it with pull requests
        - AWS
            - has direct feedback mechanism on docs (top right link)
    - Step 2: Remove barriers to get started
        - every barrier that is put in front of developer that hinders them from creating a MVP 
          is an excuse to not use it. e.g., paywall, access key generation
            - removes as many of these as possible
            - let them signin with other accounts they have (e.g., LDAP)
            - use sample access key if needed
        - good example: 
            - Twilio quickstart tutorials
                - more than just docs, but how to solve a problem using APIs
                - best way to onboard developers
            - AWS generation of SDKs per language
                - to make it easier for devs to use APIs
                - recently released go plugin for aws
    - Step 3: Be responsive
        - if people are using your stuff, congrats, but you still need to listen and be responsive
        - if you haven't already set up a dev portal, don't do forums 
            - people are already asking questions somewhere (stackoverflow)
    - Step 4: Find your hero
        - people want to know that are other people are using your product
        - e.g., architect that set up microservices for netflix
            - he did more for AWS than anyone in AWS could have done
            - his voice helped drive community of usage
        - you should highlight first users who are successful
        - example: AWS Community Heroes
    - Step 5: Be a cheerleader
        - example:
            - This week in Spring, every Tuesday (John Long)
                - list all the blog posts positive talking about spring
                - most popular blog post type on the website
            - AWS Week in Review
                - AWS announcements
                - links to cool things people are doing on aws
    - Step 6: Listen Actively
        - at AWS, over 90% of tech roadmap is created by users/customers
            - need to pay attention to people using your product
        - set up dev chats, customer advisory boards
        - listen outside normal channels (stack overflow, hacker news, etc)
        - this info should direct product roadmap
        - build what customers are asking for; they'll become more active and tell others
